# About

Hey everyone! My name is Galymzhan and I'm a passionate developer interested in
various aspects of software development including web development, programming
languages, algorithms & data structures and ways to deal with software
complexity.

This is my personal website where I'll share things I found to be useful and/or
interesting.

You can contact me via email: <span id="contactAddr">`Please, enable JS to see it`</span>. Also, I have accounts on
[Github](https://github.com/galymzhan) and [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/450449/galymzhan).

<script>
window.onload = function() {
  var q = 'kozhayev';
  var w = '@';
  var e = 'outlook';
  var r = '.';
  var t = 'com';
  var o = q + w + e + r + t;
  document.getElementById('contactAddr').innerHTML = '<a href="mail' + 'to:' + o + '">' + o + '</a>';
};
</script>
