# About

Hey everyone! My name is Galymzhan and I'm a passionate software developer interested in
various aspects of software development including web development, programming
languages, algorithms & data structures and ways to deal with software
complexity.

This is my personal website where I'll share things I found to be useful and/or
interesting.

The apparent simplicity of the website's design doesn't mean I don't know how to write CSS ;)
Rather, it's inspired by ideas expressed [here](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) and [here](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/).
